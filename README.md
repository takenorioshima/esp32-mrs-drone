MRS. DRONE is a MIDI controller that sends **preset chord progressions** straight to your gear.
It speaks both **wired MIDI (type B)** and **BLE MIDI**, and comes with handy tricks like **semitone transpose**, **octave shift**, and quirky modes like **Root-only** and **Root-down** to keep your jams fresh.

And of course, it plays nice with external footswitches (hello, BOSS FS-6 ðŸ‘‹) â€” so you can drive it hands-free on stage.
